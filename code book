Getting and Cleaning Data -- final project code book


The original data was transformed by
1.) Merging the test data and training data to create a compiled dataset.
2.) Pulling the mean and std. dev. for the relevant metrics.
3.) Naming the elements in the dataset.
4.) Creating a final dataset with the averages for the datasets.

About R script
File with R code "dataset code.R" performs the tidy dataset creation and pull.

About variables:
x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the downloaded data.
x_data, y_data and subject_data merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
features contains the correct names for the x_data dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in
